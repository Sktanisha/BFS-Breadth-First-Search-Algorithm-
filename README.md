Description: 
Here, we need to find the path and cost from the source to the destination. To solve the problem, we have taken an adjacent list and a queue. 
Initially, the distance of all nodes is 0. If a vertex is pushed to the queue, the number of visited values becomes 1. After pop the node from the queue, the adjacent nodes are pushed to the queue of that node.
